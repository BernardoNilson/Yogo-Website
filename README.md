## YOGO Website

First of all, *you are welcome!*

#### Some important points:
- That was my first website, inspired and created by [Easy Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/@EasyTutorialsVideo)
- It was developted using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap framework (v4.7.1).
- My plan is to improve this website, make it funcional.

So, this YOGO repository contains the CSS style archive with all Bootstrap reference and the HTML main page.
