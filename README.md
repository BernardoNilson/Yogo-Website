You are welcome!

#### Some important points:
- That was my first website, inspired and created by [Easy Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/@EasyTutorialsVideo)
- It was developted using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap framework (v4.7.1).
- My plan is to improve this website, make it funcional and add new features\pages.

So, this YOGO repository contains the CSS style archive with all Bootstrap reference and the HTML main page.
